<p>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</p>
<p>The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process personal Data necessarily involves the transmission of Data on an international basis. When Cubevo Data Concept collects personal information from you on the Website, Cubevo Data Concept complies to several self regulatory frameworks, including the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
<p>If you are a&nbsp;<strong>non-U.S.</strong>&nbsp;user of the Site, by visiting the Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding the processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>
<p>Individuals located in the&nbsp;<strong>European Economic Area</strong>, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data, according to the&nbsp;<strong>European Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR)</strong>. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you can exercise your data protection rights towards us in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Right to revoke authorization:</strong>&nbsp;If you have granted your authorization regarding certain types of processing operations, you can revoke this authorization at any time with effect in the future. However, the retraction doesn&rsquo;t affect the legality of the processing before the withdrawal of consent, or as long as the processing can be justified with another legal basis.</p>
<p><strong>Right of access:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to receive information about your data that we have saved.</p>
<p><strong>Right to rectification:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate data that we have stored concerning you.</p>
<p><strong>Right of erasure:</strong>&nbsp;If you wish, we will delete your data as long as other legal regulations (e.g. legal retention periods or limitations) or one of our legitimate interests (e.g. defense of our rights and claims) do not conflict with it.</p>
<p><strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong>&nbsp;You can request to limit the processing of your data.</p>
<p><strong>Right to object:</strong>&nbsp;Moreover, you can object to the processing of your data. You can exercise this right to object in the case of certain circumstances that arise from your specific situation and only for data processing whose legality is based on a balance of interests which concerns profiling or which fulfills the purpose of direct advertising. In this case, we will no longer process your data unless we are legally entitled to deny your objection. However, an objection to direct marketing, including profiling, is mandatory for us and we are no longer permitted to process your data for these purposes. Insofar as you have granted your authorization for direct advertising and you no longer wish to receive it, you must retract your authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Right to data portability:</strong>&nbsp;You also have the right to receive your data in a structured, machine-processable format or to submit it to a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints to the data protection authority:</strong>&nbsp;Furthermore, you have the right to submit complaints to any responsible data protection authority.
